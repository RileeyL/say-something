My favorite book i have read is called Legend, By Marie Lu.
Here is my favorite quote:

"I will hunt you down. I will scour the streets of Los Angeles for you.Search every street 
in the Republic if i have to. I will trick you and deceive you, lie, cheat, and steal to 
find you, tempt you out of your hiding place and chase you intil you have nowhere else to run"
